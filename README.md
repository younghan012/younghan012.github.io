# üìù Bio

I'm passionate about the intersection of **statistical rigor** and **real-world impact**. My research broadly focuses on **[Mention 1-2 key areas, e.g., Item Response Theory (IRT), psychometrics, causal inference]**. Before starting my Ph.D. at UMD, I gained foundational experience in educational assessment and data analysis while completing my Master's at Yonsei University. When I'm not running statistical simulations, you can find me **[Mention a personal hobby, e.g., hiking the local trails, trying new recipes, or playing chess]**.

# üî¨ Program of Research

My research program is dedicated to advancing **methodological tools** for creating more **valid, fair, and informative assessments and measurements**. It is currently organized around three interconnected themes:

### 1) Statistical Modeling for Measurement Invariance
* **Focus:** Developing and refining **Differential Item Functioning (DIF)** detection methods and **Multi-Group Item Response Theory (MG-IRT)** models to ensure measurement instruments operate equivalently across diverse populations (e.g., gender, race, language groups).
* **Keywords:** *DIF, MG-IRT, Mixture Models, Equity in Assessment*

### 2) Latent Variable Modeling and Applied Psychometrics
* **Focus:** Investigating the practical application of **Factor Analysis**, **Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)**, and **Causal Inference** techniques in large-scale data (e.g., NAEP, PISA) to understand complex psychological and educational constructs.
* **Keywords:** *SEM, Causal Inference, Factor Analysis, Scale Validation*

### 3) Computational Methods in Educational Data Science
* **Focus:** Exploring the use of **Machine Learning** and **Computational Statistics** to handle 'messy' data, such as missing data imputation and automated scoring, and improve the efficiency and scalability of psychometric analysis.
* **Keywords:** *Machine Learning, Computational Statistics, R/Python Programming, Missing Data*
